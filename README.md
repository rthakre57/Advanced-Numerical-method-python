SYLLABUS FOR PRACTICAL – III: (Python Programming)
NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS WITH COMPUTER PROGRAMMING 
(Minimum 15 programs be executed in Math Lab using one of the software MATLAB / R PROGRAMMING / PYTHON, etc.) 
List of topics for practical problems: 
	Find a real root of the equation 2x=〖log〗_10 x+7 between 3 and 4 correct to 3 decimal places by regula-falsi method. Then generalize the program for any equation whose real root lie between a and b. 
	2. Find a real root of a cubic equation using Newton-Raphson method, correct to four decimal places. 
	Find a double root of the equation x^3-x^2-x+1=0 by generalized Newton’s formula.
	Compare Newton-Raphson method and regula-falsi method for finding a root of the same equation in terms of rate of convergence. 
	Evaluate √12 by applying Newton’s formula correct to three decimal places. Generalize the program. 
	
	6. Obtain cube root of positive integer N and verify it for 12 by Newton’s formula. 
	7. Find the smallest root of the equation x^3-9x^2+26x-24=0, by Ramanujan’s method, generalize the program. 
	8. Develop Forward Difference Table 3.2 as suggested in Reference 1. 
	9. Find the cubic polynomial which takes the values: y(1 )=24,  y(3)=120,  y(5)=336,  y(7)=720 , and hence in particular find y(8) by Newton’s interpolation formula. 
10. Fit a curve of the form y=x/(a+bx)  to the following data (3, 7.148 ), (5,10.231), (8,13.509),  (12,16.434) Generalize the program with input of data set. 
	 Fit a straight line of the form Y=a_0+a_1 x  to the data (x_i,y_i ): 
x_i	1	2	3	4	5	6
y_i	2.4	3.1	3.5	4.2	5.0	6.0

	12. Evaluate I=∫_0^1▒1/(1+x^2 ) dx correct to 3 decimal places by Trapezoidal and Simpson 1/3rd rule with h=0.5,0.25,0.125 respectively. 
	13. Evaluate I=∫_0^1▒1/(1+x) dx correct to 3 decimal places by Romberg’s method 
	14. Match I=∫_0^1▒〖√(1-x^2 )  dx=π/4=0.785398163〗 (approx.) by Trapezoidal and Simpsons rules (both) with number of subintervals 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. 
	15. Determine the value of y when x=0.1, given that y(0)=1 and y^'=x^2+y by Modified Euler’s method. 
	16. Find y(0.1) and y(0.2) correct to 4 decimal places when dy/dx=y-x and y(0)=2 by 2nd and 4th order Runge-Kutta (R-K) methods, compare results. 
	17. Find y(0.2) when initial value problem is given: y^'=3x+y/2; y(0)=1 with h = 0.2, 0.1, 0.05 by Euler, Modified Euler and 4th Order R-K method. Compare the results. 
	18. Find y(0.8) and y(1.0) by solving y^'=1+y^2  with y(0)=0 by 4th order R-K method and correct these values by Milne’s method. 
	19. Solve numerically the equation y’=y+x with initial condition y(0)=1 by Milne’s method from x=0 to x=0.4 (Refer book by H. C. Saxena, Reference 2)
